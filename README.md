* Automatically saves progress so you can resume later
* Analyzes your performance over time
* Identifies your weakest categories
* Lets you save results to a file for review
* Runs effectively on cross platforms

## üîß Installation & Requirements

### Python 3.9+

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install PyQt6 appdirs
```
 
---
update python:

```bash
pip update Python3 #or just Python
```

---

Don't have python installed?
 click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

 ---

## üöÄ Running the App

```bash
#locate the directory in which it is downloaded (eg: cd downloads), then run:

python satprepapp.py
```

If it's your first time launching, the app will automatically create a default config file in a platform-appropriate location:

* **Windows**: `C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\SATPrepApp\`
* **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/SATPrepApp/`
* **Linux**: `~/.local/share/SATPrepApp/`

This folder will contain:

* `config.json` ‚Äî contains paths to your question banks and settings
* `progress.json` ‚Äî saves your current test state
* `analytics.json` ‚Äî stores your test history and performance trends

---

##  Adding Your Own Questions

Update the `config.json` file to point to your own question banks. The format should look like this:

```json
{
  "question_banks": {
    "rw": "/path/to/your/reading_writing.json",
    "math": "/path/to/your/math.json"
  },
  "total_questions": {
    "rw": 27,
    "math": 22
  },
  "default_time_limits": {
    "rw": 32,
    "math": 35
  }
}
```

Each question bank file should look like:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the value of x in 2x + 3 = 7?",
      "options": ["A) 1", "B) 2", "C) 3", "D) 4"],
      "answer": "B"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The main question banks will be added later on, as compiling 600+ questions into a json file isn't an easy feat.

## Features

* **Auto Resume**: Automatically saves your test in progress so you never lose work.
* **Analytics**: Tracks your scores over time and shows your weakest subjects.

This project was made with love (and insomnia). You are free to modify and redistribute it with acquired permission.

An executable for Mac/Linux/Windows will be provided soon... in the mean while you can run the python script or create your own executable (executable is platform dependent with pyinstaller)

Please ensure your question bank files follow the correct format ‚Äî mismatches will prevent questions from loading.
